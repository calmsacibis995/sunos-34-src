Because some files are expected to found in the ../machine
directory which are the same for sun2 and sun3, the following
files are actually symbolic links to files in this directory.

../machine/frame.h		-> ../sun/frame.h
../machine/pcb.h		-> ../sun/pcb.h
../machine/reg.h		-> ../sun/reg.h
../machine/scb.h		-> ../sun/scb.h
../machine/sir.h		-> ../sun/sir.h
../machine/swapgeneric.c	-> ../sun/swapgeneric.c
../machine/trap.h		-> ../sun/trap.h
