The  kernel  directory contains various important files for the ROM
Monitor.  In particular, the code entered at reset or power-up, as well
as the initial handler for all traps and interrupts, is in trap.s; more
reset code is in sunmon.c; and the command interpreter is in
commands.c.  There's also a collection of subroutines here.
