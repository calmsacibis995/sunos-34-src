The  prom2  directory contains source for most of the code which used
to be in the second Prom set of the Sun Rom Monitor.  In particular,
it contains the device drivers for the various bootable devices.

The older drivers are specific to the ROM monitor.  The newer drivers
(initially, nd and sd) are common between the ROM monitor and the Unix
standalone system.  All new drivers should be written this way, since
it reduces the effort required, and permits the ROM drivers to be called
from the standalone code, reducing the size and complexity of the bootstrap
code on the disk.

Bootcmd.c is the Monitor boot command, which vectors thru a table to the
various device bootstrap routines.
