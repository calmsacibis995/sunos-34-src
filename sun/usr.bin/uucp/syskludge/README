OVERVIEW
.PP
The uucp subdirectory enhancement
keeps the /usr/spool/uucp directory small
by putting spool files in various subdirectories.
This speeds up locking (e.g. for LOGFILE).
At Duke, "C." files are in "C./",
"D.duke" files are in "D.duke/",
and other "D." files are in "D./".
Multiple subdirectories speeds up the search for a file.
For example, "C." files are searched for in the "C." subdirectory
so no time is wasted skipping "D." files.
Further, since UN*X locks directories during search (namei()),
having multiple directories permits increased concurrency
when more than one "uu" process is running.

IMPLEMENTATION
.NH 2
CHANGES WHICH ARE EXTERNAL TO UUCP
.PP
Certain filenames are remapped at system-call time.
For example, "/usr/spool/uucp/D.decvax1234" is remapped to
"/usr/spool/uucp/D./D.decvax1234".
Also, "D.decvax" is mapped to "D./D.decvax" provided
that the last chdir(II) was to "/usr/spool/uucp".
The list of filename prefixes which are mapped are given
in the prefix table in syskludge.c.
As distributed, files beginning "D.duke" are put in /usr/spool/uucp/D.duke,
other "D." files are put in subdirectory "D.",
and "C." files are put in the "C." subdirectory.
.PP
This change is implemented by providing a "syskludge.a"
library which has special versions of open(II), link(II), etc.

CHANGES TO UUCP ITSELF
.PP
When searching for work ("C." files),
uucp looks in /usr/spool/uucp/C. rather than /usr/spool/uucp.
.PP
This change is implemented by minor changes to uucp itself.
If "C." files were not mapped, no changes to uucp proper would be needed.
