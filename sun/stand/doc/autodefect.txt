\fBAUTODEFECT EXTERNAL SPECIFICATION\fR
.sp
.sh 1 "INTRODUCTION"
.sp
.sh 2 "Purpose"
.lp
\fIAUTODEFECT\f Rprogram,
.np
reads defect list recorded by manufacturer in Xebec format,
.np
translates the defect list into Adaptec format,
.np
formats the disk, surface analysis, and labels the disk.
.sp
.sh 2 "Applicable Documents"
.lp
The following documents are useful in understanding the diagnostic
and the overall functinoality of the program:
.np
\fIXebec S1410 5.25 Inch Winchester Disk Controller
.np
\fISun SCSI Programmers\' Manual\fR, W. M. Bradley
.np
\fISun SCSI Board Theory of Operation\fR, W. M. Bradley
.np
\fIIntroduction to he SASI/SCSI Interface and the Adaptec Controller\fR,
5/23/83, Bill Stanley, Adaptec Inc.
.np
\fIAdaptec ACB 4000 and 5000 Series Disk Controllers OEM Manual\fR, 5/16/83,
Adaptec Inc.
.lp
\fIAt this time the above specifications have not yet been assigned part
numbers\fR.

.sh 1 "SYSTEM OVERVIEW"
.sp
.sh 2 "General Description"
.lp
Basically this program will be used in R/I as an initial defect translation
and test for varaiety of disks supportted by sun manufacturing. It reads
the defect map on the disk by Xebec controller and converts it to
the format acceptable by Adaptec controller. Then formats with the defect
list, surface analysis and labels the disk. 
.sp
.sh 2 "Features "
.lp
The AUTODEFECT program provides the user the following features:
.np
Fully automated test.
.np
Non destructive in the case if the disk has already been formatted 
by Adaptec.
.lp
There is a utility for adding, deleting, printing the defect list
which can be accessed by entering CONTROL-C while it is in the
format phase. This routine will be a great help in case of additional
defects must be entered.
.sp
.sh 2 "Required Configuration"
.lp
The following hardware is required:
.np
A test station containing:
.(l
   *  a card-cage (PN: 340-0332),
   *  two power supplys (PN: 300-0135-03),
   *  a Sun 2 processor board (PN: 501-1007-01),
   *  one megabyte of memory (PN: 501-1013-01),
   *  a means of booting the SCSI diagnostic, and
   *  a monitor.
.)l
The monitor may either be a ``\fIdumb terminal\fR'' or a Sun monitor,
video board, and keyboard.
.np
A \fBknown good\fR Xebec controler.
.np
A \fBknown good\fR Adaptec board (PN: 370-1010-01)
.br
with a jumper on A-B in switch J5.
.np
A power cable for Adaptec board (PN: 530-xxxx-x).
.np
A power cable for the disk (PN: 530-xxxx-x).
.np
A power cable for Xebec board (PN: 530-xxxx-x).
.np
The internal cable running from the SCSI board to the Adaptec and
Xebec board.
.np
The internal cable running from Xebec and Adaptec board to the disk.
.sp

.sp
.sh 2 "Error Handler"
.lp
Upon recieving an error the test will print the error message 
and immediately terminates the process. Possible errors could be
a mulfunction in one of the hardware pieces such as: disk, Adaptec or
Xebec board, and cables. 
.sp
.sp
.lp

.sp
.sh 1 "RUN PROCEDURE"
.sp
.sh 2 "Pre-Loading"
.lp
Configure the workstation as described above and load the Autodefect
program.
.sh 2 "Starting the Translation"
.lp
Enter one of the following PROM monitor command:

	>bec(,n)stand/autodefect
.br
or,
.br
	>bie(,n)stand/autodefect

where n is the ethernet server id in hexedecimal.
.lp
The program will display the following messages:
.sp
        Auto Defect Handler    Rev. 3/11/85 
.sp
    	Enter drive selection:
.br
                0 -- Micropolis 1304 (50 Mb)
.br
                1 -- Micropolis 1325 (85 Mb)
.br
		2 -- Fujitsu M2243AS (85 Mb)
.br
    	Which one?
.lp
User must enter 0, or 1 based on the type of disk is being used.
.br
Then displays the following messages:
.sp
    	Enter type of test:
.br
                0 -- complete surface analysis test 
.br
                1 -- partial  surface analysis test
.br
                2 -- no surface analysis test
.br
    	Which one?
.sp
.br
User enters 0, for full surface analysis, 
.br
1, for partial surface analysis, or
.br
2, for no surface analysis test at all.
.sp
.lp
If anything other than 0-2 entered, the program
displays the following error message:
.sp

    	number out of range -- reenter 
.sp
.lp
Full surface analysis analyzes the disk starting from cylinder 0
till the last cylinder, where partial surface analysis analyzes
25 cylinders from beginning and 25 cylinders from the end of disk.
.lp
After the selection phase, program will start actual translation
and displays the following messages on each step:
.sp
    	Adaptec trys to read defect list

    	The disk not formatted by Adaptec, try with Xebec

    	Internal diag test completed.
    
    	Ram diag test  completed.

	Reading defects from disk by Xebec controller...

	Now the defect list has been set to Adaptec format.

    If disk does not have the defect list either in Xebec or in Adaptec
    format it will ask the operator to add defects for each head.

    If none was entered, it will display:
.sp
	No disk defect list found, or entered
.br
	Disk will be formatted without defect list.
.sp
    And it proceeds:

	SCSI format.

	DISK FORMAT - DESTROYS ALL DISK DATA!
.br
	Format done

	Seek

	SURFACE ANALYSIS - DESTROYS ALL DISK DATA!

	Surface analysis complete.

	label this disk ...

	verify label

    And prints partition infomation.
.lp
At this point the translation and the test is complete. The following
messages will be displayed:
.sp
	      If you want to test another drive, attach the cables
.br
	      and power on the drive

	      Enter :

	          s : start next drive

	          f : reformat the drive

	          m : select drive type

	          q : quit testing

If anything other than the above options entered, it will display:

	      Unknown command, re-enter
