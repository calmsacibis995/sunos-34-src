The  h  directory contains all the header files for the ROM monitor.

Note: various of these files also include other header files, in particular
globram.h includes many others.  Where this has caused problems, the
included files have been modified to only expand themselves usefully one
time, by doing #ifndef FOO, #define FOO, ...(the real body), #endif FOO.
Often, the file would be #define-ing something anyway, so that was used
instead of making up a FOO.

I am trying to discourage this trend, but it is necessary in some
places to avoid every module's having to include eight or ten files.
