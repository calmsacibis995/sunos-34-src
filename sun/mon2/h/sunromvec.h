/*
 * sunromvec.h
 *
 * This file defines the entire interface between the PROM Monitor
 * and programs (or kernels) that run under it.
 *
 * The main interface is the vector table at the front of the boot rom.
 *
 * This vector table is the only knowledge the outside world has of this prom.
 * It is referenced by hardware (Reset SSP, PC), and software.
 * Once located, no entry can be re-located unless you change the world
 * that needs it.
 * 
 * The easiest way to reference elements of this vector is to say:
 *
 *	*romp->xxx
 *
 * as in:
 *
 *	(*romp->v_putchar) (c);
 *
 * This is pretty cheap as it only generates   movl 0xNNNNNNNN:l,a0; jsr a0@ .
 * That's 2 bytes longer, and 4 cycles longer, than a simple subroutine call.
 *
 * Various entries have been added at various times.  As of Rev N PROM
 * Monitors, the vector table includes an entry "v_romvec_version" which
 * is an integer defining which entries in the table are valid.  The
 * comments on each entry say which version the entry first appeared in
 * with a prefix like "V1:".  To determine if the PROMs your program is
 * running under contain the entry, you can simply compare the value
 * of v_romvec_version to the constant in the comment field, e.g.
 *
 *	if (romp->v_romvec_version >= 1)
 *		{ reference *romp->v_memorybitmap...}
 *	else
 *		{ running under older prom, punt somehow }
 *
 * Entries which do not contain a "Vn:" string are in Version 0 of the
 * proms (Rev N and onward).
