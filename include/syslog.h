/*
 *  SYSLOG.H -- declarations for system logging program
 *
 *	These are used as the first parameter to logmsg().
 *	Their meanings are approximately as follows:
 *
 *	LOG_ALERT -- this priority should essentially never
 *		be used.  It applies only to messages that
 *		are so important that every user should be
 *		aware of them, e.g., a serious hardware failure.
 *	LOG_SALERT -- messages of this priority should be
 *		issued only when immediate attention is needed
 *		by a qualified system person, e.g., when some
 *		valuable system resource dissappears.  They get
 *		sent to a list of system people.
 *	LOG_EMERG -- Emergency messages are not sent to users,
 *		but represent major conditions.  An example
 *		might be hard disk failures.  These could be
 *		logged in a separate file so that critical
 *		conditions could be easily scanned.
 *	LOG_ERR -- these represent error conditions, such as soft
 *		disk failures, etc.
 *	LOG_CRIT -- such messages contain critical information,
 *		but which can not be classed as errors, for example,
 *		'su' attempts.
 *	LOG_WARNING -- issued when an abnormal condition has been
 *		detected, but recovery can take place.
 *	LOG_NOTICE -- something that falls in the class of
 *		"important information"; this class is informational
 *		but important enough that you don't want to throw
 *		it away casually.
 *	LOG_INFO -- information level messages.  These messages
 *		could be thrown away without problems, but should
 *		be included if you want to keep a close watch on
 *		your system.
 *	LOG_DEBUG -- it may be useful to log certain debugging
 *		information.  Normally this will be thrown away.
