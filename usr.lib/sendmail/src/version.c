Don't artifically add a "from: $q" when running the queue -- this seems
to cause the from line in the qf file to be ignored.

delimit addresses (as well as spaces)

D 3.322	83/03/06 16:30:29	eric	341	340	00000/00000/00005
MRs:	201
Handle messages with "Resent-xxx:" header lines properly (basically mark
the message as being resent); ignore incoming From: lines if their text
exactly matches our machine-readable address exactly -- this causes the
full name to be added when called from (e.g.) MH.  Both of these mode are
to improve interaction with MH.

explicitly before doing other rulesets; some general cleanup.

D 3.197	82/09/11 17:18:16	eric	216	215	00000/00000/00005
don't assign $s to be the sending host (this mucks up Received:
lines) -- instead just use HELO messages; chdir into queue directory
and make all pathnames relative; be more conservative in creating
queue id's -- in the event you get file table overflows, etc.

D 3.195	82/09/08 22:13:20	eric	214	213	00000/00000/00005
fix a nasty botch in 3.194 that killed SMTP in daemon mode.   sigh......

D 3.194	82/09/08 21:20:05	eric	213	212	00000/00000/00005
try to avoid "Interrupted system call" on wait in deliver and on
writes; fix returned message to have proper sender; handle extra
mailer output more cleverly.

D 3.193	82/09/06 19:55:17	eric	212	211	00000/00000/00005
more hacking on oldstyle -- always assume sender fields are in new
style so that locally generated fields are edited correctly.

D 3.192	82/09/06 18:47:26	eric	211	210	00000/00000/00005

user SMTP fixes to talk to ISI

D 3.187	82/09/06 16:24:51	eric	206	205	00000/00000/00005
install new state-driven scanner; make everyone use it, thus fixing
problems of quoted commas, etc.

D 3.186	82/09/05 18:08:58	eric	205	204	00000/00000/00005
change $g processing from a macro substitution per mailer to two sets
of rewriting rules per mailer -- one each for sender and recipient
fields; convert to NBS standard on Return-Receipt-To: and Precedence:
fields; clean up From: processing code and generalize it to all
sender fields; tune debugging code; clean up canonname.

D 3.185	82/09/05 11:48:27	eric	204	203	00000/00000/00005
add $* to match zero or more and $> to make a "subroutine" call; stick
in initial hooks for per-mailer rewriting; improve diagnostics in readcf,
including number lines; increase the number of rewriting sets.

D 3.184	82/09/01 10:24:00	eric	203	202	00000/00000/00005
log entering uid & pid; allow CANONUSER ($:) to abort a rewriting set.

increase MAXMAILERS to 25

D 3.182	82/08/31 10:05:56	eric	201	200	00000/00000/00005
clean up reply code processing some more; in particular, give more
detail in many messages.  process connection failures correctly.

D 3.181	82/08/29 23:31:35	eric	200	199	00000/00000/00005
handle comments and quotes in headers; still doesn't deal with
backslashes however -- prescan should be cleaned up to deal with
this case.  it turns out there are many bugs in prescan; it should
be extensively rewritten.

D 3.180	82/08/29 17:32:49	eric	199	198	00000/00000/00005
fix serious botch in SMTP reply code delta; change a bunch of
"Internal error" codes to a new "Remote protocol error" -- so that
I don't get blamed for things that other systems do.

D 3.179	82/08/29 16:52:31	eric	198	197	00000/00000/00005
do a better job at interpreting SMTP reply codes

D 3.178	82/08/29 15:52:20	eric	197	196	00000/00000/00005
give 554 message on syserr (instead of 451) if errno == 0; as it
was some permanent errors appeared transient

D 3.177	82/08/27 18:01:25	eric	196	195	00000/00000/00005
hack crackaddr to strip blanks off the end of a cracked address; this
happens because "u at h" becomes "$g  " (with two spaces at the end).
this doesn't solve the general case (e.g., "u at h (me)" comes out as
"$g   (me)", with three spaces), but does handle the ugliest case.
besides, the "at" syntax is supposed to go away.

D 3.160	82/08/20 20:35:15	eric	179	178	00000/00000/00005
time stamp the SMTP greeting message; increase the buffer size in
syslog to prevent core dumps.

D 3.159	82/08/17 20:45:43	eric	178	177	00000/00000/00005
change Mail-From: to Received: for new SMTP spec (RFC821); handle
folded lines in queue files correctly.

D 3.158	82/08/17 16:19:10	eric	177	176	00000/00000/00005
rework header processing: do special purpose header munging in a
separate routine so that the queue run can do it also; parse From lines
in a fancy way, extracting the address part and turning it into a $g
macro; avoid reading and processing core files that end up in the queue
directory; check the queue directory name for legality; fix the verify
(-bv) option.

D 3.157	82/08/15 17:35:39	eric	176	175	00000/00000/00005
mark From: lines with the H_FROM bit; make VRFY work by adding the
QuickAbort flag; handle headers more cleverly in queue files -- this
seems to work, but I am frankly nervous.  Note: this version
represents a flag day!-- old queues will not process properly.

D 3.156	82/08/15 11:58:25	eric	175	174	00000/00000/00005
output class rather than priority in log; accept zero intervals in
event scheduling; allow continuation lines in queue files (particularly
for headers); don't diagnose inappropriate errors when accepting a
connection; fix bug when reprocessing addresses that put garbage in
the header; some misc. debugging info (-d14 => commaize)

D 3.155	82/08/08 21:15:44	eric	174	173	00000/00000/00005
make "sleep" work correctly even in the face of other events; clean
up the queue processing: child queue runs now go away when done.  more
debugging logging is needed to verify that this works right though.

D 3.154	82/08/08 17:05:19	eric	173	172	00000/00000/00005
move remotename() from deliver.c to parse.c; change default log level
to 9; put error versus success delivery on different log levels;
diagnose overlength lines in headers; more general event mechanism;
initial implementation of canonname; don't diagnose link errors in
queue, since another daemon could have grabbed it legitimately;
fix a problem in VRFY on bad addresses

D 3.153	82/08/08 01:00:25	eric	172	171	00000/00000/00005

By default, just queue up the mail for most mailers and deliver
from the queue.  This avoids the wild process problem in netnews
(or so we hope).

D 3.149	82/07/27 23:09:04	eric	168	167	00000/00000/00005
clean up semantics of daemon mode to facilitate use of other IPC;
move some code to main.c because it is not part of creating a
connection; if you can't create a socket assume there is another
sendmail running and exit; improve the verbose information in an
SMTP connection to make it more obvious which messages went which
way; don't attempt delivery if you get an error reading the queue file.

D 3.148	82/07/25 13:11:20	eric	167	166	00000/00000/00005

D 3.142	82/07/14 09:25:11	eric	161	160	00000/00000/00005
don't accidently unlink a null pointer in finis(); change the way
it decides whether to remove the temp file (you don't want to if you
are queueing it up); fix a bug in Apparently-To: that caused it to
output both pre- and post-expanded names (only output pre-expanded)

D 3.141	82/07/05 20:56:24	eric	160	159	00000/00000/00005
flush fatal error flag before returning error messages to avoid error
message loop; improve debugging: flush transcript before doing things
that might take a long time, add some info to debug messages; extend
configuration on timeouts so that text of error message is in conf.c

D 3.140	82/07/05 18:49:49	eric	159	158	00000/00000/00005
add "Apparently-To:" field if no recipients are in the header.

D 3.139	82/07/05 13:21:21	eric	158	157	00000/00000/00005
count Mail-From: lines to get a hop count, giving error as
appropriate after collection; don't attempt delivery of message if
errors occur before or during collection; fix a bug in -as mode
(non-daemon SMTP).

D 3.138	82/07/05 12:37:23	eric	157	156	00000/00000/00005

if you interrupt a queue run process.

D 3.134	82/07/02 10:00:16	eric	153	152	00000/00000/00005
be paranoid about resetting the "FatalErrors" flag -- always reset
after forking for daemon or queue mode.  This will prevent false error
return delivery.

D 3.133	82/07/02 09:43:39	eric	152	151	00000/00000/00005
take special care in outputing error messages to the transcript;
a little bit of paranoia never hurt a mail system.

D 3.132	82/06/30 22:39:22	eric	151	150	00000/00000/00005
open a separate transcript in the child of a daemon.

D 3.127	82/06/26 11:56:51	eric	146	145	00000/00000/00005
add _kill command to SMTP.  this is probably dangerous in the
outside world.

D 3.126	82/06/25 19:38:24	eric	145	144	00000/00000/00005
add debugging information to server smtp code: _debug to set
Debug, _verbose to set verbose, and _showq to show the send queue
(already existant, just a name change)

D 3.125	82/06/23 12:12:19	eric	144	143	00000/00000/00005

D 3.119	82/06/16 14:51:16	eric	138	137	00000/00000/00005
allow connection refused as a temporary error; make sure there is
always someone to return the mail to on error

D 3.118	82/06/16 14:29:20	eric	137	136	00000/00000/00005

D 3.117	82/06/07 23:53:26	eric	136	135	00000/00000/00005
allow multiple connections; call putline to output FULL_SMTP
lines (to limit line lengths, etc.); involves adding an asm.sed script
to the makefile

D 3.116	82/06/07 07:54:55	eric	135	134	00000/00000/00005
make transcripts verbose always; misc. message cleanup, etc.

D 3.115	82/06/07 07:06:13	eric	134	133	00000/00000/00005
strip out xlate stuff -- this belongs at a different level

D 3.114	82/06/06 23:13:08	eric	133	132	00000/00000/00005
avoid loops by not sending to owner-owner-* -- just send to
owner-owner instead

D 3.113	82/06/06 23:05:17	eric	132	131	00000/00000/00005
implement alias owner feature.  this actually works for any user.
basically, if the alias owner-xxx exists, errors sending to xxx will be
sent to that alias rather than to the sender.

D 3.112	82/05/31 19:03:47	eric	131	130	00000/00000/00005
make temp files the correct modes in all cases

D 3.111	82/05/31 18:49:50	eric	130	129	00000/00000/00005
pass lint.  notice that definitions in llib-lc have changed for
alarm() and sleep() calls {arg was unsigned, is now int}.

D 3.110	82/05/31 17:10:51	eric	129	128	00000/00000/00005
eliminate -V, -D, -p flags in favor of a single flag "-bx"
(be in mode x).

D 3.109	82/05/31 15:35:57	eric	128	127	00000/00000/00005
don't output SMTP/FTP error codes in transcript file

D 3.108	82/05/31 15:32:18	eric	127	126	00000/00000/00005
finish implementing envelopes.  it's not completely clear to me that
this is really the way to go, but it seems clearly better than what
i had before.  this delta includes many other minor changes, so it
should probably not be blithely removed.

D 3.107	82/05/30 10:25:35	eric	126	125	00000/00000/00005
add M_FULLSMTP (``X'' flag in .cf file) for eventual implementation
of full SMTP.  This version must support such garbage as line limits,
address length limits, return-path, etc.

D 3.106	82/05/29 20:00:30	eric	125	124	00000/00000/00005
allow the user with name "daemon" to send mail as anyone s/he wants.

D 3.105	82/05/22 02:05:48	eric	124	123	00000/00000/00005
add "junk mail" -- error responses are never returned.

D 3.104	82/05/22 01:38:07	eric	123	122	00000/00000/00005
add "envelopes" to contain the basic information needed as control
info for each message.  currently there is only one envelope -- this
being the obvious stupid conversion.  later there will be separate
envelopes for error messages, return receipts, etc.

D 3.103	82/05/20 17:46:07	eric	122	121	00000/00000/00005
add dfopen as a "determined fopen" -- it retries if it gets recoverable
errors.  we use it for returning mail (to dead.letter) and creating the
temp file.  the whole idea is to avoid dropping things on the floor on
heavily loaded systems.  this is untested, since it seems impossible to
fill up the inode or file tables on this VAX (but it works if the open
succeeds).

D 3.102	82/05/15 12:29:36	eric	121	120	00000/00000/00005
add the 'R' flag to mailers, saying to rewrite the recipient addresses
to be relative to the recipient.  This makes reply code easy, but
confuses user mail programs that are expecting to have to rewrite
recipient addresses.  In general, the receiving host must be "smart"
for this to work.

D 3.101	82/05/06 20:21:14	eric	120	119	00000/00000/00005
allow socket number on [IPC] connections -- eventually this
could be used to handle other low-level protocols.

D 3.100	82/03/27 20:15:12	eric	119	118	00000/00000/00005
delete neat remotename feature, because it doesn't work right in
UUCPland -- and breaks stupid hosts.  'Twill be fixed, I promise.  Time
must be spent figuring out how to define the civilized versus the
uncivilized world.

D 3.99	82/03/27 19:57:44	eric	118	117	00000/00000/00005
compensate for bug in getlogin: can return the empty string ("")
for certain error conditions rather than the NULL pointer.

D 3.98	82/03/22 22:37:54	eric	117	116	00000/00000/00005
continue the impossible task of tracking Bill Joy

D 3.97	82/03/22 22:10:44	eric	116	115	00000/00000/00005
more cleanup for new 4.2 system configuration and some more fixes
for vanilla V7

D 3.96	82/03/20 18:13:01	eric	115	114	00000/00000/00005
take % as an acceptable name terminator in GECOS field
("in-care-of") -- for TEF%UCSFCGL

D 3.95	82/03/20 16:12:27	eric	114	113	00000/00000/00005
16 bit changes -- should have no effect on VAX binaries to
speak of.

D 3.94	82/03/06 16:11:49	eric	113	112	00000/00000/00005
get queue scanning working correctly in conjunction with daemon mode

D 3.93	82/03/06 15:35:49	eric	112	111	00000/00000/00005
have daemon mode assume SMTP mode

D 3.92	82/03/06 15:08:24	eric	111	110	00000/00000/00005
give correct error message in SMTP if some of the addresses are not ok

D 3.91	82/03/06 14:52:22	eric	110	109	00000/00000/00005
arrange to be able to accept a connection from any host.

D 3.90	82/03/06 14:15:55	eric	109	108	00000/00000/00005
collapse special character processing into macro processing for
simplicity of code.

D 3.89	82/03/06 12:09:18	eric	108	107	00000/00000/00005
clean up error handling in IPC case; fix a minor bug in headers in
queueing code; make SMTP mail multi user per connect.

D 3.88	82/03/05 10:45:48	eric	107	106	00000/00000/00005
remove silly $U dependency in UGLYUUCP code

D 3.87	82/03/05 10:13:06	eric	106	105	00000/00000/00005
include direct connect on outgoing mail if the pathname is "[IPC]" --
this gives minimal number of processes for ethernet mail.

D 3.86	82/02/27 12:29:31	eric	105	104	00000/00000/00005
more work on after $g translate rewriting

D 3.85	82/02/27 11:37:42	eric	104	103	00000/00000/00005
implement "return receipt requested".

D 3.84	82/02/27 09:51:36	eric	103	102	00000/00000/00005
improve rewriting of "after $g translate" to correspond to the
real world.....

D 3.83	82/02/26 21:56:10	eric	102	101	00000/00000/00005
implement daemon mode

D 3.82	82/02/26 19:02:33	eric	101	100	00000/00000/00005
default to OldStyle headers -- this turns out to be needed so that it
will work right when running as a server.

D 3.81	82/02/22 19:59:16	eric	100	99	00000/00000/00005
some hacks to make the ethernet community happier -- .cf changes only

D 3.80	82/02/22 19:32:12	eric	99	98	00000/00000/00005
be much more clever about splitting up addresses when doing header
rewriting.  become NewStyle automatically based on heuristics; this
makes some other addresses work, although there are conceivably
sites that this could break.  Perhaps we should default to OldStyle?
I don't think this would break anything.

D 3.79	82/02/20 16:56:02	eric	98	97	00000/00000/00005
output names in a nice comma-separated fashion in messages -- this
opens up other possibilities

D 3.78	82/02/20 12:59:46	eric	97	96	00000/00000/00005
expand macros in rewriting rules early to allow multi-word macros to
be processed correctly.

D 3.77	82/02/20 12:12:09	eric	96	95	00000/00000/00005
add the -c flag, to cause sendmail to just queue messages that are for
mailers that are expensive; a later instantiation can come around and
send them in a batch.  Also, pass macro definitions through the
queueing code so that macros can be expanded later rather than sooner;
this is important for destination dependent macros such as $g.

D 3.76	82/02/04 20:31:21	eric	95	94	00000/00000/00005
add host aliasing; add -p flag.  this version doesn't yet know about
replacing the text of the host alias into the message however.  syntax
is grotty: "/hostmatch:%s@newhost" or whatever.

D 3.75	82/01/23 14:21:06	eric	94	93	00000/00000/00005
add M_UGLYUUCP flag; only catch names with leading slash as filenames;
let the user redefine their full name; don't pass -r or -f to uux.

D 3.74	82/01/10 21:57:33	eric	93	92	00000/00000/00005
cleanup from cbosgd (Mark Horton) testing; some internals, mostly
configuration.  This tries to make the configuration file (cf.m4) be
much more general, but I fear it is doomed to failure -- it may be
better to just tell people to roll their own.

D 3.73	82/01/05 09:59:19	eric	92	91	00000/00000/00005
fix botch in UGLYUUCP code -- gave "remote from <dest>" instead of
"remote from <source>"

D 3.72	82/01/01 18:39:43	eric	91	90	00000/00000/00005
know about all known Berknet host names so that we can handle the "."
notation happily in the full name representation.

D 3.71	82/01/01 18:27:15	eric	90	89	00000/00000/00005
send to dead.letter using sendto/recipient/deliver mechanism rather
than mailfile; this fixes a bug with the "from" name and seems like
a better abstraction.

D 3.70	81/12/06 12:39:10	eric	89	88	00002/00000/00003
cleanup so it will go through lint without any fancy grep -v's;
change the way SCCS Id's are handled.

D 3.69	81/12/05 14:14:06	eric	88	87	00000/00000/00003
insert SMTP "Mail-From:" line.

D 3.68	81/12/05 11:53:41	eric	87	86	00000/00000/00003
put the SMTP and queueing code on compilation flags so that sendmail
will fit on non-ID PDP-11's (ugh); put the ugly UUCP hack on a
compilation flag also to emphasize that it sucks eggs; makefile
cleanup.

D 3.67	81/11/27 21:37:05	eric	86	85	00000/00000/00003
this is a stupid hack to put "remote from <host>" lines on the From
lines going to UUCP mail.  someday i hope to rip out this stupidity.
it is triggered by any mailer named "uucp" -- it ought to be a special
flag, but i refuse to legitimize antique hacky mistakes.

D 3.66	81/11/22 19:17:45	eric	85	84	00000/00000/00003
Edit queue control files when running queue (assuming there are still
recipients left).  Also, modify the MsgPriority to be the absolute
number (not the Priority: value); this allows us to include aging into
the priority algorithm.

D 3.65	81/11/21 18:42:47	eric	84	83	00000/00000/00003
change the send queue to be only one queue instead of one per mailer.
this is slightly inefficient but simpler.  also, pass this queue
around so we can have multiple send queues.  this makes VRFY work.

D 3.64	81/11/21 16:38:29	eric	83	82	00000/00000/00003
convert to SMTP draft 3 -- finishing touches.  Punt on the VRFY/
EXPN commands for now; they aren't required anyhow.  Move the fullname
into the address structure so it can be inherited.

D 3.63	81/11/11 20:24:07	eric	82	81	00000/00000/00003
integrate user SMTP into sendmail itself.  If there is no $u arg
in the mailer argument list, SMTP is run.  This can be used directly
over the Ethernet or to any clever mailer.  We still need to edit
spooled control files to remove recipients that have been successfully
sent during queue processing.

D 3.62	81/11/08 13:00:21	eric	81	80	00000/00000/00003
know about SMTP over TCP.  The current SMTP user is not clever
enough to deal with multiple users at one host.  To fix this we will
have to speak some smart protocol between sendmail and the mailer --
maybe SMTP??

D 3.61	81/11/07 15:41:39	eric	80	79	00000/00000/00003
clean up to compile & work on ARPAVAX; move stat file to
/usr/lib/sendmail.st; fix bug in syserr with error codes

D 3.60	81/10/31 22:12:47	eric	79	78	00000/00000/00003
drop old NCP stuff for ARPANET handling; fix some bugs in error
messages with multiple recipients in SMTP; clean up error handling

D 3.59	81/10/27 12:24:51	eric	78	77	00000/00000/00003
experimental version combining queueing with daemon operation.
I'm sure this doesn't work -- if only because the wait()s are funny.

D 3.58	81/10/27 10:50:52	eric	77	76	00000/00000/00003
More queueing cleanup: implement timeouts (still one-stage),
properly implement priorities (didn't work before), and miscellaneous
cleanup.

D 3.57	81/10/26 14:22:34	eric	76	75	00000/00000/00003
Install new experimental queueing facility -- one stage timeout,
etc.  This version is still quite incomplete.  It needs to reorder
the queue after some interval, do two-stage timeout, take option
info from the queue file instead of the command line, read the
sender's .mailcf file, etc.  Some of this is useful for SMTP also.

D 3.56	81/10/23 19:38:09	eric	75	74	00000/00000/00003
Eliminate magic MN_LOCAL and MN_PROG; change q_mailer item in ADDRESS
to be pointer to mailer rather than index.

D 3.55	81/10/22 10:25:29	eric	74	73	00000/00000/00003
move stats file to /usr/lib; put location of sendmail.hf in conf.c

D 3.54	81/10/22 09:43:48	eric	73	72	00000/00000/00003
take fullname from /etc/passwd if Smtp mode and sender name
is indeed local.  Also accepts names more often; this is probably
a disaster for sender verification.

D 3.53	81/10/22 09:14:30	eric	72	71	00000/00000/00003
implement HELP and MRSQ -- MRSQ is a partial implementation
of old MTP -- in particular, To: fields in MAIL commands are not yet
implemented.  The "message" routine now takes first args of the form
"999-" to specify continuation.

D 3.52	81/10/20 11:36:24	eric	71	70	00000/00000/00003
clean up the SMTP stuff some more

D 3.51	81/10/19 22:27:17	eric	70	69	00000/00000/00003
implement SMTP mode -- doesn't support source routing or the
HELP command, and doesn't give the correct code on VRFY or forwarding.
Maybe someday....

D 3.50	81/10/17 16:58:04	eric	69	68	00000/00000/00003
initial prep to put in Daemon mode

D 3.49	81/10/12 10:04:19	eric	68	67	00000/00000/00003
throw in some "errno = 0;"'s to make syserr's more accurate;
take any -f flag if debug mode and uid==euid.

D 3.48	81/10/08 22:55:37	eric	67	66	00000/00000/00003
ignore interrupts and hangups while calling mailer.

D 3.47	81/10/08 09:13:30	eric	66	65	00000/00000/00003
fix botch in backup code during rewriting

D 3.46	81/10/06 19:12:57	eric	65	64	00000/00000/00003
change rewriting rules to use $N on RHS to match LHS, and include
$=X (class match) in the matching; this will allow us to match the
proposed "user.host@domain" syntax as well as the old syntax, by
putting the known domains into a class to disambiguate.

D 3.45	81/10/02 11:05:21	eric	64	63	00000/00000/00003
arrange to give the correct "from" person on error messages.

D 3.44	81/10/02 10:07:38	eric	63	62	00000/00000/00003
use ruleset 2 to rewrite names after the $g translate (to fix some
forwarding problems; do a read check in putmessage (just in case
the temp file disappeared); some general cleanup.

D 3.43	81/09/30 10:00:20	eric	62	61	00000/00000/00003
fix the <> syntax, convert "at" to "@" in from addresses also,
plus some minorness to get the multi-machine case going nicely.

D 3.42	81/09/29 18:22:25	eric	61	60	00000/00000/00003
change processing of From: person; basically, this mod deletes the
Original-From: line if redundant with the generated From: line, uses
the Original-From: line for the From: line if possible, and a host of
other such trivialities.

D 3.41	81/09/29 14:59:00	eric	60	59	00000/00000/00003
fix hash function computation for symbol table on 16-bit machines

D 3.40	81/09/28 19:17:29	eric	59	58	00000/00000/00003
enable aliases to self-reference themselves correctly.

D 3.39	81/09/24 10:30:44	eric	58	56	00000/00000/00003
changes to work under a V6 system -- mostly compilation flags

D 3.38.1.1	81/09/23 18:23:19	eric	57	56	00000/00000/00003
break some configuration into conf.h -- simplifies makefile changes
on different machines.  But there are still conditional libraries, so
this may not be a good idea.....

D 3.38	81/09/23 09:52:23	eric	56	55	00000/00000/00003
fix bug in file modes when mailing to files that didn't exist before;
add an 'F' line to the .cf file that will read class entries from
another file, given a scanf string to do the parsing.

D 3.37	81/09/22 13:24:25	eric	55	54	00000/00000/00003
fix problem with using macros in rules; change configuration to send
different flags when destined for arpanet vs. berknet hosts, etc.

D 3.36	81/09/22 11:33:29	eric	54	53	00000/00000/00003
finally make suppression of sender in mailing lists work -- this version
also works correctly on simple aliases.

D 3.35	81/09/21 18:49:53	eric	53	52	00000/00000/00003
fix suppression of from address in mailing lists.

D 3.34	81/09/20 10:46:32	eric	52	51	00000/00000/00003
don't let a mailer ever execute as root (that should solve the
security problems!) -- essentially just map root into someone else.
Adds yet another configuration variable (should this be in the .cf file?

D 3.33	81/09/16 20:04:26	eric	51	50	00000/00000/00003
take underscore as well as space to separate parts of a person's
full name.  Dot notation should be made to work someday also.

D 3.32	81/09/16 17:16:19	eric	50	49	00000/00000/00003
have .forward ownership stick harder than :include: ownership:
this prevents cretins from using writable root files for nastiness.
all this is pointless if /usr/lib/aliases is writable though....

D 3.31	81/09/16 16:39:44	eric	49	48	00000/00000/00003
be REALLY clever and inherit uid/gid from owner of :include:
files also...   solves problem of alias to non-secure file

D 3.30	81/09/16 16:24:19	eric	48	47	00000/00000/00003
last delta was too paranoid -- this increases the number of
cases that work (but is still safe -- I hope)

D 3.29	81/09/16 16:08:08	eric	47	46	00000/00000/00003
run as the user forwarding mail after a .forward operation;
fix a bug in .forwarding that caused recursive expansion;
restrict mail to programs, files, and with :include: for security
reasons.

fix $u argument processing bug (happened in uucp); .cf file cleanup

D 3.18	81/08/31 21:22:39	eric	36	35	00000/00000/00003
collect mail statistics; minor configuration changes

allow "error" as a net name to print error messages

D 3.16	81/08/29 19:16:24	eric	34	33	00000/00000/00003
drop unnecessary H_FORCE bits in conf.c; delete H_DELETE

D 3.15	81/08/27 11:42:58	eric	33	32	00000/00000/00003

Arrange to pull full name out of From line if found; includes
Original-From: hacking (oh so ugly).  There's got to be a better way
to do this...

D 3.10	81/08/22 14:45:27	eric	28	27	00000/00000/00003
fix UNIX From line parsing problem; add $b macro to get
